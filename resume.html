                        I developed an AI-powered Legal Document Scanner platform for the legal team to automatically scan and analyze vendor contracts. The platform uses AI to generate summaries highlighting clauses that are acceptable or not acceptable to Groww based on configurable legal standards. This pre-screening tool, still in active use, significantly reduces the manual effort required by the legal team to review vendor contracts.
